    <li>1 cinnamon stick</li>
    <li>4 cardamom pods, crushed</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon cumin seed</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon coriander seeds</li>
    <li>4 whole cloves</li>
    <li>3 1/2 cups water, or as needed to cover</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Rice</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>2 cups sella basmati rice</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon canola oil</li>
    <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
    <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1 cup matchstick carrots</li>
    <li>1/2 cup raisins</li>
    <li>1/2 cup slivered almonds</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon cumin seed</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1 cardamom pod, shell removed and seeds crushed into a powder</li>
    <li>1 whole clove</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Steps</h3>

  <ol>
    <li>Make the broth: Place halved onion, garlic head, cinnamon stick, cardamom pods, pepper, cumin seed, salt, sugar, paprika, coriander seeds, and cloves into a pressure cooker. Pour in water to cover.</li>
    <li>Close the cooker securely and place the pressure regulator over the vent according to manufacturer's instructions. Set to high and heat until steam escapes in a steady flow and makes a whistling sound, about 5 minutes. Reduce to medium and cook for 20 minutes. Let the pressure release naturally, about 10 minutes. Unlock the lid and remove.</li>
    <li>When the broth is almost finished, start the rice: Soak rice in cool water for 5 minutes, then rinse until water runs clear.</li>
    <li>Strain cooled broth into a bowl. Clean out the pressure cooker, then place over medium heat and add oil.</li>
    <li>Add onion and garlic to the cooker; cook and stir until softened and browned, 7 to 10 minutes. Stir in carrots and cook until soft, about 3 minutes more. Add strained rice, raisins, almonds, cumin seed, pepper, cardamom powder, and clove. Stir to combine, then pour in enough broth to cover.</li>
    <li>Close the cooker securely and seal the vent; set to high and heat until the first whistle, 5 to 7 minutes. Reduce to medium and cook for 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and let rest for 7 minutes, then let pressure release naturally, about 10 minutes. Immediately transfer cooked rice to a serving dish to prevent overcooking.</li>
  </ol>
